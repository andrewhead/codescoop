For compilation and runtime instructions, see the README for
the [Github repository for this
example](https://github.com/andrewhead/jsoup-1.4).

One important note to make is that your system should have
an `/etc/smtp.conf` file including the username and password
of a throwaway Gmail account to run this file.  See those
instructions for more details!
