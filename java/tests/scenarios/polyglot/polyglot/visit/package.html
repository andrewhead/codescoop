Contains the standard visitor which provide type checking as well as
output.  The visitor specification is defined in {@link
polyglot.visit.NodeVisitor polyglot.visit.NodeVisitor}.  

{@link polyglot.visit.HaltingVisitor HaltingVisitor} provides a 
method to prune the visitor traversal.

{@link polyglot.visit.ContextVisitor ContextVisitor} contains code
to automatically enter and leave scopes and to manage error messages.
Most other visitors are subclasses of this class.

{@link polyglot.visit.PrettyPrinter PrettyPrinter} is <strong>not</strong>
a visitor (the package name is a misnomer for historical reasons).
It contains methods for pretty printing the AST.

The code generator is implemented by the {@link polyglot.visit.Translator
Translator} translator class, which is {@link polyglot.visit.PrettyPrinter
PrettyPrinter} that opens appropriate Java output files.
