These files test a bug we found with disambiguation of member classes.
To run the test, compile CollectionsTester.  In addition, either
(1) none of the other object (.class or .java) files should exist, or
(2) run the test with the -noserial flag.
The point being that if those files do exist, and are used instead of the
source file being recompiled, the bug won't occur.
