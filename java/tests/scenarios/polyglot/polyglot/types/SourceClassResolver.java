/**
 * Loads class information from source files, class files, or serialized
 * class infomation from within class files. An outline of the steps is
 * given below.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> When the polyglot translator looks for a class by the name
 * "foo.bar.Quux" it first searches for that class in any file given
 * on the command line. If the class is found one of these files, then
 * this definition is used and the remainder of the steps are
 * skipped.
 *
 * <li>If none of these files contain the desired class, then the source
 * path is searched  next. For example, if the source extension is
 * ".jl" and the source path is "mydir:." then the translator looks
 * for files "mydir/foo/bar/Quux.jl" and "./foo/bar/Quux.jl".
 *
 * <li> Regardless of whether or not a source file is found, the translator
 * searches the classpath (defined as normal through the environment
 * and command-line options to the interpreter) for the desired class.
 *
 * <li>If no source file exists, and no class is found then an error is
 * reported (skipping the rest of the steps below).
 *
 * <li>If a source file is found, but no class, then the source file is
 * parsed. If it contains the desired class definition (which it
 * should) then that definition is used and the remainder of the steps
 * are skipped. (If it does not contain this definition, an error is
 * reported and the remainder of the steps are skipped.
 *
 * <li>If a class is found but no source file, then the class is examined
 * for jlc class type information. If the class contains no class type
 * information (this is the case if the class file was compiled from
 * raw Java source rather than jlc translated output) then this class
 * is used as the desired class definition (skipping all steps below).
 *
 * <li>(class, but no still no source) If the class does contain jlc class
 * type information, then the version number of translator used to
 * translate the source which created the given class file is compared
 * against the version of the current instantiation of the translator.
 * If the versions are compatible, then the jlc class type information
 * is used as the desired definiton. If the versions are incompatible
 * (see the documentation in Compiler.java) then an error is reported.
 * In either case, all remaining steps are skipped.
 *
 * <li>If both a suitable source file and class are found then we have a
 * choice. If the class definition does not contain jlc class type
 * information then the source file is parsed as the definition found
 * in this file is used as desired definiton and we stop here. If the
 * class does contain jlc class type information, then continue.
 *
 * <li>(source and class with jlc info) Next the last modification date of
 * the source file is compared to the last modification date of the
 * source file used to generate the class file. If the source file is
 * more recent, the it is parsed as used as the desired definition and
 * all remaining steps are skipped.
 *
 * <li>(source and class with jlc info) Next the jlc version of the class
 * and of the current translator are compared (as in 7.). If the
 * verisions are incompatible, then we use the definition from the
 * parsed source file. If the versions are compatible, then we use
 * the definition given by the jlc class type information.
 * </ol>
 * Finally, if at any point an error occurs while reading jlc class type
 * information (e.g. if this information exists but is corrupted), then
 * an error is reported.
